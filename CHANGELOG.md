## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **WinGet submit:** Verify the `winget-pkgs` fork is synced with upstream before `wingetcreate submit`, and document manual sync via `gh api merge-upstream` when the PAT lacks the `workflow` scope.
- **Dependencies:** Bump `anyio` to 4.14.2 (CVE-2026-63374, CVE-2026-64847).
- **Chocolatey:** Use PNG package icon, fail `choco push` on non-zero exit codes, add `chocolatey-submit` workflow and CUDA moderation recovery docs (`docs/chocolatey_cuda_moderation.md`).

## [1.3.53] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- **Web search:** Fix `UnboundLocalError` on `@internet` / WEB routes caused by a shadowed `get_retrieval_profile` import in `LLMWorker`.
- **Web search (@internet):** Stop injecting the “internet disabled” system prompt when composer `@internet` forces a live search while the global internet toggle is off.
- **Web answers:** Detect cross-source epistemic conflicts (e.g. scheduled vs completed outcome snippets) in general-web bundles and add synthesis guidance so the model does not merge incompatible claims.
- **Settings (form layout):** Improve card form row sizing on macOS and narrow layouts — top-aligned multi-line labels, wrapped path/status text, and tighter vertical sizing for toggles and action rows.
- **CI (Windows):** Refit settings selector width in layout tests after `show()` so font metrics match production and widest labels are not elided on Windows.
- **Release CI:** Pin `action-gh-release` to v2.6.0, upload assets sequentially, delete orphan draft releases before publish, and upload large Windows installers last to avoid concurrent asset upload failures.
- **Dependencies:** Bump `soupsieve` to 2.9.2 (CVE-2026-85999, CVE-2026-86000).
- **Updates:** Manual update fallback now points users to both the Qube website and GitHub Releases; Linux AppImage detection reads `APPIMAGE` via `os.environ`.

## [1.3.52] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- **macOS Dock:** Restore the main window when the Dock icon is clicked after hide-to-tray (red X), without affecting menu bar tray or Desktop Companion single-click use.
- **Settings (macOS):** AI Engine and local model rows expand to the full card width on narrow layouts instead of collapsing left.

### Changed
- **WinGet auto-submit:** Sync the fork before opening PRs; skip submit when an open PR already exists for the version; document PAT requirements and tolerate sync failure without failing the release job.

## [1.3.51] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **WinGet / Defender docs:** investigation playbook and WDSI submission guide for CUDA `Validation-Defender-Error`.
- **Release checksums:** publish SHA-256 for all Windows installers in GitHub Release notes and attach `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

### Fixed
- **CUDA first-run bootstrap:** Remove the 20-minute post-install “install grace” path that skipped bootstrap consent and model downloads on fresh CUDA installs (including GitHub downloads and the installer’s Launch Qube step). First launch now runs the normal bootstrap flow. Explicit `--winget-validation` remains for release CI smoke only.

## [1.3.50] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **TTS Kokoro inference:** Upgrade `kokoro-onnx` to 0.6.1 so the `speed` input matches the bundled `kokoro-v1.0.onnx` model (float32). Fixes ONNX Runtime `INVALID_ARGUMENT` errors during voice preview and playback on installed builds.

## [1.3.49] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **TTS voice preview (Windows):** Use Kokoro's synchronous `create()` API instead of async `create_stream()` so the TTS worker does not hang on Windows and block Settings preview / output test buttons.
- **TTS output device fallback:** When the selected output device is unavailable, persist the working system-default device for playback instead of retrying the bad index on every preview.
- **TTS preview diagnostics:** Log Settings preview requests, queueing, playback failures, and completion in `Qube.Audio`.

## [1.3.48] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **TTS (installed builds):** Bundle Kokoro dependency assets in PyInstaller — `language_tags`, `phonemizer`, and `espeakng_loader` (native library + espeak-ng-data) — so TTS loads on Windows, macOS, and Linux frozen builds.
- **Bootstrap Nemotron download:** Point Nemotron 3 Nano 4B Q8 at the public `unsloth/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-GGUF` repo (fixes 401 Unauthorized from the gated `bartowski/...-BF16-GGUF` catalogue entry).

## [1.3.47] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Windows audio devices:** Filter duplicate PortAudio endpoints (prefer WASAPI) so Settings input/output lists align with Windows Sound; refresh device menus when opened so hot-plugged USB/Bluetooth devices appear without restart.
- **TTS voice settings (Windows):** Load Kokoro when ONNX + voices are on disk even if the PyAudio output stream fails at boot; retry with the system default output device; auto-reload when opening Voice & Audio or using TTS Refresh; disable the voice picker and preview buttons until the engine is ready; surface specific load/preview errors instead of a generic message.
- **Bootstrap consent:** Allow feasibility checks to skip RAM enforcement when appropriate so low-memory sessions can still proceed with disk-only guidance.
- **Light theme splash:** Improve splash card text contrast on light backgrounds.

## [1.3.46] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **Kokoro TTS download (bootstrap + Settings):** ONNX assets now download from the official `thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx` GitHub release instead of removed files on `hexgrad/Kokoro-82M` (fixes 404 on first-run bootstrap and **Download base TTS model**).
- **Composer `@[file:…]` mentions:** exclude the built-in Qube help corpus from file picker results; ignore tool/category routing tokens when filtering filenames.
- **Frameless modals (Windows/Linux):** centralize prestige-style dialog chrome so borders and translucency re-apply reliably after the native window handle exists.
- **Windows silent uninstall wipe:** Inno Setup supports `/DELETEUSERDATA=1` to remove `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Qube` and `%USERPROFILE%\.qube` during silent uninstall; fix `{userprofile}` expansion via `{%USERPROFILE}`.
- **WinGet install grace:** post-install validation runs without mock bootstrap downloads; diagnostics distinguish smoke vs install-grace paths and write grace boot traces for CUDA release CI.
- **Dependencies:** bump `pypdf` to 6.16.1 (CVE-2026-84309/84310/84311).

### Added
- **Release CI (CUDA):** richer WinGet validation smoke failure output (mode, grace trace) and clearer wait/retry handling in `smoke_installed_cuda.ps1`.

## [1.3.45] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **Native model reload feedback:** changing GPU layers, CPU threads, or context limit in Settings → AI & Models shows a success toast when the model reload completes (including CPU-fallback loads).
- **Native load CPU fallback:** when GPU offload or context allocation fails (``Failed to create llama_context``), automatically retry on CPU before surfacing an error.

### Fixed
- **Model Manager branding (installed builds):** publisher logos, Official badges, and “Official model by / Modified by” detail lines resolve bundled assets via ``resource_path()`` (fixes missing branding on Windows/macOS/Linux PyInstaller installs).
- **STT Whisper (legacy cache layout):** resolve bundled Whisper from flat ``stt/small/`` or Hugging Face hub-cache snapshots so Linux dev installs with only ``models--Systran--…`` weights load correctly.
- **Chat without a conversational model:** universal “open Model Manager” prompt replaces the hardcoded Qwen 3.5 9B bootstrap download when no GGUF is loaded.
- **Native GGUF load errors:** modal dialog with actionable hints for missing shards, non-chat models (ASR/embed), and memory/context failures (previously log-only).
- **Windows GPU defaults:** when VRAM cannot be detected (typical Vulkan/iGPU installs), default GPU layers to **0** (CPU) and cap the slider at 32 instead of ~74 layers that commonly fail ``llama_context`` creation.
- **PyInstaller voice assets:** bundle ``kokoro_onnx`` (``config.json``) and ``openwakeword`` pretrained ONNX models so TTS and wakeword work on installed builds.
- **Release CI (Windows CPU):** silent install after the upgrade smoke no longer hangs on Inno ``AppMutex``. Setup now terminates running ``Qube.exe`` before the mutex check (same as uninstall), and install smokes stop the process tree and wait for exit before launching the next Setup.exe.
